Welcome to my Webscraping/Twitter Bot! <br />
Twitter handle:@keepyourpoints <br />
Hosted in google cloud. <br />
Runs public_sharp.py once a day at 6:15PM which leads to scrape nhl,nba,ncaafb,ncaambb all to run. <br />
Each script scrapes vsin.com and sorts the data by public % then tweets top 4 in respected league. <br />
Finally it runs once overall and tweets the overall data sorted. <br />
On weekends that will run at 11:00AM and scrape_nfl will only run on sundays! <br />
