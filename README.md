Welcome to my Webscraping/Twitter Bot!
Twitter handle:@keepyourpoints
Hosted in google cloud.
Runs public_sharp.py once a day at 6:15PM which leads to scrape nhl,nba,ncaafb,ncaambb all to run.
Each script scrapes vsin.com and sorts the data by public % then tweets top 4 in respected league.
Finally it runs once overall and tweets the overall data sorted.
On weekends that will run at 11:00AM and scrape_nfl will only run on sundays!
